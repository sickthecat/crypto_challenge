In shadows deep, where a secrets dwells,
A tale unfolds, a somber spell.
Thirteen steps upon a twisted plot,
Where darkness creeps and dreams are caught.

Through moonlit nights and whispered fears,
A world unseen, where anguish sears.
Thirteen souls, forever lost,
In a labyrinth of anguish, tossed.

Their hopes decay, like petals wilt,
Within this realm of shadows built.
Rotting memories cling to the air,
Thirteen echoes of despair.

But amidst the gloom, a glimmer bright,
A spark of hope, a guiding light.
Thirteen hearts, they beat as one,
A chance to break free, what's done is done.

Through trials fierce, they find their way,
Unraveling the darkness, come what may.
Thirteen warriors, their spirits untamed,
With resilience and strength, they're unashamed.

In the face of adversity, they rise,
Thirteen stars gleaming in night skies.
From rotting depths, new life they glean,
The power of thirteen, a force unseen.

Thirteen paths they navigate encoded,
One by one, they conquer fate.
Roaming through the twists and turns,
Onwards, their determination burns.

Together, united, they stand tall,
Defying odds, they won't let it fall.
Reaching for triumph, refusing to stop,
Overcoming challenges, from bottom to top.

Thirteen hearts, a resolute choir,
Radiating strength, fueled by fire.
Thirteen times they rise and ascend,
A testament to resilience, they transcend.

In shadows deep, their spirits rise,
Thirteen souls, embracing the skies.
Forever bound by a shared dream,
Thirteen, a number, their victory gleams.
Remember our triumph.
