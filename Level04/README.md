<pre> <p>In the realm of numbers, a symphony takes flight,
Prime numbers dancing, enveloped in light.
Pristine and profound, they proudly reside,
RSA's foundation, where secrets abide.

Pristine primes, P and Q, pillars of might,
Bound in secrecy, veiled from sight.
Their whispers entwined, a cryptographic dance,
Breathing life into encryption, leaving no chance.

Radiant secrets, within primes they're sealed,
Resilient guardians, their power revealed.
RSA's beauty, like ripples in a pond,
Dependent on primes, where mysteries respond.

Quintessence of security, rare and discreet,
Prime numbers entangled, their union complete.
Raising the shield, privacy's fortress stands,
Resonating with strength, the world understands.

Reverberating echoes of primes, steadfast and true,
RSA's symphony plays, melodies imbued.
Resilient chords, encryption's allure,
A harmonic blend, securing what's pure.

Dancing in digits, they dynamically combine,
Dualities in motion, where secrets align.
Primes intertwining, an intricate maze,
Defying intrusion, they hold secrets ablaze.

Divine enigmas, protecting what's dear,
Disguised in the numbers, away from all fear.
The delicate balance, decryption's demand,
Revealing the truth, held within their command.

RSA's symphony, a masterpiece unrolled,
Derived from primes, a story yet untold.
Prestigious and potent, the code it unfurls,
Dwelling in the realm where secrets it hurls.

So, let us cherish the power of primes,
Delighting in RSA's wondrous chimes.
The dance of secrecy, forever unmarred,
In the tapestry of numbers, they remain starred.`
